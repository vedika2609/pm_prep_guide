## Score Breakdown

## Strengths
- Clear writing tone  
- Shows understanding of MCP value  
- Included critical metric (integration time reduction)  
- Good narrative intent  
- Sections structured correctly  

---

## Gaps
- Elevator pitch is about YOU, not the PRODUCT  
- Missing API / routing / SLAs / tenant isolation details  
- “Constraints & Tradeoffs” left blank  
- Personas unclear, mixed, incomplete  
- Impact section underdeveloped  
- No strong business-oriented “ask”  
- Missing strategic framing (North Star, KPIs, why now)  

---

## Must Fix Before Day 2
- Rewrite elevator pitch (≤30 words, product-first, value-focused)  
- Add missing technical depth (API surface, SLAs, context flow, routing)  
- Define 3 personas sharply, not mixed or phrased as problems  
- Fill tradeoffs section (mandatory for platform PM)  
- Strengthen quantifiable impact & metrics

## Next Steps
Complete the follow-up questions in `follow-up.md`, then submit **Day 1 (v2)** for re-evaluation.
