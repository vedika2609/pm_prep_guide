## Score Breakdown

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Problem Framing & Scope | 7/10 | Personas correct but pains still generic |
| Product Thinking | 7/10 | Good clarity; needs stronger strategic narrative |
| Technical Depth | 7/10 | Mentions auth, governance, SLAs; lacks architecture specifics |
| Metrics & Success | 6/10 | Needs a clear North Star + supporting metrics |
| Prioritization & Tradeoffs | 6/10 | Tradeoffs listed but not applied to decisions |
| Communication | 8/10 | Clear, structured, concise |
| Leadership & Influence | 7/10 | Good ownership; limited stakeholder alignment detail |

---

## Strengths
- Clean structure and improved clarity  
- Correct personas  
- Stronger ownership and technical scope  
- Good narrative flow  
- Tradeoffs section added  

---

## Gaps
- Elevator pitch is descriptive, not value-based  
- Impact section still missing:  
  - 90% AI workflow adoption  
  - 2× insight speed  
  - 5 features in 6 months  
  - $4M influenced pipeline  
- No North Star metric  
- Problem statement too surface-level  
- Personas could be sharper  
- Ask needs stronger business framing  

---

## Must Fix Before Proceeding to Day 2
1. Rewrite elevator pitch (≤30 words, product-first, value-centric)  
2. Strengthen impact section with full quantified metrics  
3. Add architectural specificity (routing, auth model, request lifecycle, context assembly)  
4. Refine personas + pains (clear, sharp, business-tied)  
5. Rewrite the “ask” using business outcomes
