### **A. 30-Second Elevator Pitch**  
I lead MCP Server — the orchestration layer enabling secure, low-latency LLM and agent workflows over governed financial data, reducing enterprise AI integration time from 4 weeks to 3 days.

---

### **B. 3-Minute Hiring Manager Overview**

**Headline:** MCP Server powers all AI workflows inside Aquata — enabling secure, fast, multi-model orchestration over sensitive, multi-tenant financial data.

**Context:**  
Aquata serves 40+ global investment firms and processes ~10M records/day. Clients need a trusted mechanism to connect LLMs and agents to governed datasets with strict audit, isolation, and compliance requirements. Before MCP, every integration required ~4 weeks of bespoke engineering work, creating friction, governance risk, and limited AI adoption.

**My Ownership:**  
I define the MCP roadmap, architecture strategy, API surface, request lifecycle, routing logic, SLAs, and developer enablement. I partner closely with Engineering, ML Infra, Security, and GTM teams to align long-term platform capabilities with client workflows.

**Impact:**  
- Reduced integration time **4 weeks → 3 days** (93%)  
- Delivered **5 AI features in 6 months** (vs 2 earlier)  
- Enabled **2× faster** contextual insights  
- Achieved **90% adoption** for AI workflows  
- Influenced **$4M+ pipeline** via differentiated capabilities  

**Constraints & Tradeoffs:**  
- P95 latency <200ms  
- Token cost control  
- Tenant-level isolation  
- Auditability + traceability  
- Deployment safety for financial clients  

**Next Step / Ask:**  
I need **2 backend engineers and 1 ML Infra engineer** to ship contextual caching + dynamic policy enforcement, reducing per-query cost by 25% and enabling deeper client-level configuration.

### **C. Problem Statement (Personas + Pains)**  
Investment analysts, platform engineers at client firms, and GTM/onboarding teams struggle to integrate LLMs with governed datasets because the process is slow, brittle, and unsafe.  
**Top pains:**  
- Multi-week integrations & inconsistent APIs  
- Limited auditability / tenant controls  
- Heavy PS dependency for onboarding
