# Day 1 submission — ready for review

### **A. 30-Second Elevator Pitch**  
The Arcesium MCP server enabled the internal teams to build and integrate enterprise AI solutions and it empowers our users to access the platform capabilities from the AI agent of their choice   


### **B. 3-Minute Hiring Manager Overview**
**Headline:**
Arcesium's MCP server powers all AI workflows enabling authenticated, fast, multi model orchestration workflows over the data stored in Aquata  

**Context:**  
Aquata serves to a global client base of more than 40 investment firms. It is of utmost importance to ensure strict isolation of data in a multi tenant setup and compliance to authentication and authorization. With MCP server being a reality we have successfully not just reduced the AI integration time but have also reduced engineering efforts and security risks associated to AI adoption 

**My Ownership:** 
I define the end to end MCP roadmap including SLAs, Authentication, Authorization, Governance, API surface, Metrics, Developer workflow improvements and Audits

**Impact:**  
- Reduced integration time for Enterprise AI from 4 weeks to 3 days
- Enabled faster data insights for Aquata users by enabling them to access Arcesium MCP servers from the MCP client of their choice of AI agent
- Increased adoption for AI workflows compared to the previous state when only Aquata Copilot was the available mode of enabling AI workflows

**Constraints & Tradeoffs:**
- Latency vs cost vs accuracy
- Multi tenant performance vs customization
- Token costs vs context window length
- Governance vs flexibility

**Next Step / Ask:**  
I need budget and 2 AI engineers along with a backend engineer to implement enterprise grade A2A protocol so that i can quickly deliver the AI agents that i have planned 

### **C. Problem Statement (Personas + Pains)**  
**2–3 distinct personas**
- Platform engineer (client)
- Investment analyst
- Internal AI teams

**Top 3 pain points:**  
- Multi-week integrations & inconsistent APIs for platform engineerin
- Information overload for financial data analysts 
- Givernance risk and huge efforts to integrate LLM in their workflows
