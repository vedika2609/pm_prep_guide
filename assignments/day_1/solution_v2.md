# Day 1 submission — ready for review

### **A. 30-Second Elevator Pitch**  
The Arcesium MCP server enabled the internal teams to build enterprise AI solutions and it empowers our users to access the platform capabilities from the AI agent of their choice   


### **B. 3-Minute Hiring Manager Overview**
**Headline:**
Arcesium's MCP server powers all AI workflows enabling authenticated, fast, multi model orchestration workflows over the data stored in Aquata  

**Context:**  
Aquata serves to a global client base of more than 40 investment firms. It is of utmost importance to ensure strict isolation of data in a multi tenant setup and compliance to authentication and authorization. With MCP server being a reality we have successfully not just reduced the AI integration time but have also reduced engineering efforts and security risks associated to AI adoption 

**My Ownership:** 
I define the end to end MCP roadmap including SLAs, Authentication, Authorization

**Impact:**  
- Reduced integration time for Enterprise AI from 4 weeks to 3 days
- Enabled faster data insights for Aquata users by enabling them to access Arcesium MCP servers from the MCP client of their choice of AI agent
- Increased adoption for AI workflows compared to the previous state when only Aquata Copilot was the available mode of enabling AI workflows 

**Constraints & Tradeoffs:**
- 

**Next Step / Ask:**  
Now that MCP server is a reality, the direction in 2026 will be more on building agents and support for enterprise grade A2A protocol to offer a streamlined capability to build and deploy multi agentic architecture enabling agentic AI capabilities in the hands of the user.  

### **C. Problem Statement (Personas + Pains)**  
**2–3 distinct personas**
- For the FD team and the platform engineers of the client it is extremely difficult to integrate with AI (LLMs) ensuring governance and the slowness and the risk in the process
- For the financial data analysts, analysing the large data is tedious and manual process with AI being the epicenter

**Top 3 pain points:**  
- Limited tenant controls in multi tenant systems
- Multi week manual integration process 
- Huge manual overheads for financial data anlysts who have to look at multiple screens, but in the world of MCP they can control it all via the AI agent of their choice, ensuring the data being proactively available rather than reactively available
